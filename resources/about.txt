Information:
ZigZen is a software application entertainment product designed to 
simulate the experience of completing a jigsaw puzzle. Emphasis is 
placed on creating an experience accurate to real life, in order 
to capture the relaxing feeling associated with completing a real 
jigsaw puzzle. The product leverages strengths of a computer 
environment to allow for quality-of-life and ease-of-use features 
not possible in a real jigsaw puzzle. However, the product is 
careful not to include any overly-flashy features that would 
distract from the experience. Although intended as an entertainment 
product, ZigZen is a simulation first and a computer game second.
